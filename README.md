If you see this error 'The babel-runtime npm package could not be found in your node_modules' after you download the ZIP file and run it on your local. please run this command to fix it 'meteor npm install --save babel-runtime'

TODO List:
  1. Performance need pagination for blog fetch;
  2. For CRUD, we may provide better user experience, however now it works;
  3. Security, we only have basic function, still need improvement;
  4. This blog is based on the tutorial https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app, we will refactor the code after we gain more knowledge about meteor;
  5. Testing
